#This/100 will be the percent chance that a chest will spawn for a person
#No fractions or percents, only a number with a decimal
#EG: This is 50, so there would be a 50/100 chance that a chest would spawn every time a player joins the match
#Default: 33.333333333 so that there is a 1/3 chance (33.333333/100) that a chest would spawn for them
percent-chestspawn: 33.333333333333333333
